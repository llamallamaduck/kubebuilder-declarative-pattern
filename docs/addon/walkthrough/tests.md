# Testing

We have two main types of tests:

* [Golden File tests](#golden-file-tests) which run a StandardOperator on an input object, generate a
  manifest, and compare it to expected output.
* [E2E tests](#e2e-tests) which bring up a real cluster, invoke the operators and can then
  check that the code is performing as expected.

We believe this combination strikes a good balance between coverage and making
it easy to write tests.

The kubebuilder tests, which bring up an embedded apiserver and perform some
basic testing, feel unnecessary with the other two approaches.


## Golden File Tests

### Background

The bulk of these tests are implemented in `pkg/tests` via the `StandardValidator`.
The test scans a `tests` directory for `*.in.yaml` files, runs the operator for each 
of them, and compares the output to `*.out.yaml` files.

It is also possible to provide `*.side_in.yaml` file that contains resources that
should exist before the resource defined in `*.in.yaml` is applied. These resources
are going to be created before running a test, and cleaned up upon finishing. They
will be accessible via Get and List.

We perform simple comparison-of-output tests, any changes
to the output are treated as test failures, and printed as a diff. 
This means that the output is materialized and checked in to the repo; this
proves to be very handy for understanding the impact of a change.

There's also a helpful "cheat" function, which rewrite the output when you run
the tests locally - set the HACK_AUTOFIX_EXPECTED_OUTPUT env var to a non-empty
string.  This is useful when you have a big set of changes; it's just as easy to
review the changes yourself in the diff and there's not a ton of value in typing
them out.

This is the approach that we use in kops, and it works well - particularly with
the env-var cheat code.

### Usage

1. Remove the autogenerated tests
   ```bash
   cd <your operator>/
   find . -name "*test.go" -delete
   ```
1. Create a new golden file test for your controller in 
   `pkg/controller/{{operator}}/{{operator}}_controller_test.go`

   ```go
    package {{operator}}
    
    import (
      "testing"
    
      api "{{operator}}/pkg/apis/addons/v1alpha1"
      "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/tests"
    )
    
    func TestController(t *testing.T) {
	v := golden.NewValidator(t, api.SchemeBuilder)
	dr := &{{operator}}Reconciler{
		Client: v.Client(),
	}
	err := dr.setupReconciler(v.Manager())
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("creating reconciler: %v", err)
	}

	v.Validate(dr.Reconciler)
    }
   ```

1. Create a basic input to the test based on the autogenerated CR instance. This should be updated
   if you have any required fields
   
   ```bash
   mkdir --p pkg/controller/{{operator}}/tests
   cp k8s/resources/addons_v1alpha1_{{operator}}.yaml pkg/controller/{{operator}}/tests/simple.in.yaml
   ```

1. Generate the test output
   ```bash
   cd pkg/controller/{{operator}}/tests
   touch tests/simple.out.yaml
   HACK_AUTOFIX_EXPECTED_OUTPUT=1 go test ./...
   ```

1. Verify the output is reproducible
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

1. Update the BUILD.bazel file your controller package to pull in the channel and test data
  
   ```bazel
   filegroup(
       name = "testdata",
       srcs = glob(["tests/**"]),
   )

   go_test(
       name = "go_default_test",
       srcs = ["{{operator}}_controller_test.go"],
       data = [
           "testdata",
           "//{{operator}}-operator/channels",
       ],
      // remainder unchanged, eg embeded, deps, ..
   )
   ```

1. Verify bazel can run the test:
   ```bash
   bazel test //{{operator}}-operator/...
   ```

## E2E tests

### Background

End to End tests spin up a Kubernetes cluster with no default addon management via a modified 
[kube-up.sh](../../kubernetes/cluster/kube-up.sh), deploy each operator to the cluster, 
create a CR for each operator, and run each operators validation.

An example is to deploy KubeProxy, create a KubeProxy CR, then validate the KubeProxy DaemonSet is
deployed.

### Setup

Your operator needs to provide a set of manifests in a the following structure:

```text
foo-operator/
  k8s/
    crds/ - FooCrd lives in here
    operators/ - All the manifests to deploy the operator (including RBAC)
    resources/ - An example CR instance of Foo
```

This structure is not autogenerated. You can use the generated kubebuilder manifests to populate it:

```bash
cd foo-operator/
mkdir -p k8s/crds k8s/operators k8s/resources
cp config/crds/* k8s/crds
cp config/manager/* k8s/operators
cp config/samples/* k8s/resources
```

### Adding Tests

For this example, we will be adding a test for KubeDNS. 
All code changes will live in [smoketest.go](../../../hack/smoketest.go).

1. Create a test class that inherits from `CommonAddonsTest` and a constructor.

   ```go
   type KubednsTest struct {
     CommonAddonTest
   }
    
   func NewKubednsTest(c CommonAddonTest) *KubednsTest {
     t := &KubednsTest{CommonAddonTest: c}
     t.Base = "kubedns-operator"
     return t
   }
   ```
   
    This will deploy your operator from `k8s/{crds,operators}` and CR from `k8s/resources/` .

1. Create a verify function to assert your operator successfully deployed its workload:

   ```go
   func (k *KubednsTest) Verify() error {
   	h := k.Harness
   
   	err := verifyReadyPods(h, defaultSystemNamespace, "kube-dns")
   	if err != nil {
   		return err
   	}
   
   	return nil
   }
   ```
   
   This function will be called periodically until it returns nil (indicating success) or a
   timeout is reached (indicating failure).
   
   There are several `verify*` functions avaliable for your test to use. See other implementations
   for inspiration.

### Running Tests

By default, the test will use your local kubeconfig to deploy and test the operators:

```bash
go run smoketest.go
```

You can create and destroy a fresh cluster with the following flags:

```bash
go run smoketest.go --cluster-up=true --cluster-down=true
```
